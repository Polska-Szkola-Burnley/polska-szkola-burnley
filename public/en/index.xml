      <description>Polish School in Burnley offers high quality teaching level thanks to qualified teaching staff. We teach Polish language with elements of history and geography. In addition, we run artistic classes, where students have the opportunity to dance, sing, paint or draw. Lessons are original, interesting and unusual. Our pupils are the most important thing for us, so we take care of their overall mental development and educate them in a Christian spirit.</description>
