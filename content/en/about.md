## School history

The Polish Saturday school in Burnley started operating in September 2009.At the August meeting of the Association of Poles from Burnley and the surrounding area, a unanimous decision was made to create an educational institution to promote Polish culture.The resolution was the result of the concern of Polish citizens staying temporarily or permanently in England for the common good and preservation of the native language, which plays a very important role in shaping culture and strengthening national ties.Therefore, the primary goal of our school is to promote Polish culture.

Ewa Kopacka was the first manager of the facility, and from 15.01.2011 Mrs. Monika Deptuś took over the duties.In addition, the Polish Saturday school in Burnley organizes artistic and musical classes for our students to promote Polish children in the local environment.When we talk about the beginnings of our school, one cannot ignore the fact that we have changed our headquarters several times.

At the beginning we used rooms at Catholic churches in Burnley, because the church, as the only institution, was and is open to our actions.From October 2010 to December 2013, we rented Linkbridge Center, with which we organized several events together to bring together communities from different cultures.
Since January 2014, the school headquarters is the Sir John Thursby Community College building in Burnley at Eastern Avenue.
WE INVITE YOU!
