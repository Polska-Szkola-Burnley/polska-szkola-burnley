**The Polish School in Burnley** welcomes children and their parents/guardians on Saturdays from 9.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. We offer high quality teaching thanks to our qualified teaching staff. We teach Polish language with elements of history and geography. In addition, we run art classes where students have the opportunity to dance, sing, paint or draw. Lessons are original, interesting and unusual. Our pupils are the most important thing for us, therefore we take care of their general mental development and educate them in the Christian spirit.
