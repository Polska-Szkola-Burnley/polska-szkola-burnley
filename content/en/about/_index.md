The Polish Saturday School in Burnley was launched in September 2009. At the August meeting of the Association of Poles from Burnley and the surrounding area, a unanimous decision was made to establish an educational institution to promote Polish culture. The resolution was the result of the concern of Polish citizens staying either temporarily or permanently in England for the common good and the preservation of their mother tongue, which plays a very important role in shaping culture and strengthening national bonds. For this reason, the primary objective of our school is to promote Polish culture.

The teaching staff

The first head teacher was Mrs Ewa Kopacka, and since 15.01.2011 Mrs Monika Deptu≈õ has taken over her duties. In addition, the Polish Language Saturday School in Burnley organises art and music classes for our students to promote Polish children in the local community. When we talk about the beginnings of our school, we cannot ignore the fact that we have changed our premises several times.

In the beginning, we used the rooms at the Catholic churches in Burnley, as the church, as the only institution, was and is open to our activities. From October 2010 to December 2013 we rented LINKBRIDGE CENTRE, with whom we organised several events together to bring communities from different cultures together. Since January 2014, the school has been based in the Sir John Thursby Community College building in Burnley on Eastern Avenue. INVITE!
